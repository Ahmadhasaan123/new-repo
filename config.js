      "you are the sunshine in my darkest days and the stars in my night sky. Every moment with you feels like magic, and I fall in love with you more each day. You're not just my girlfriend, you're my best friend, my soulmate, and my everything. I love you beyond words! 💖",

      "I’m really sorry for whatever hurt you, and I never want to be the reason your heart feels heavy. You matter to me more than words can explain — not just as someone I love, but as someone I deeply care for, respect, and admire. I don’t want to lose the softness we have… the way we talk, laugh, annoy each other, and then melt again.  I miss that.      I miss you. And I want you to know something honestly… When you’re upset, it doesn’t just make me sad — it reminds me how much your happiness means to me.  You are special to me, Tayyba.  In a way I can’t compare with anything else.  You’re the kind of person I don’t want to treat carelessly. I’m not perfect, but I promise I care.  I’m here, I’m yours, and I’ll always try to do better — for you, for us.  Come back to me with that soft smile, please.  I miss it… I miss us.",
